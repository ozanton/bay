## DWH project work and data model revision
Given - a table with information about orders in an online store.
The task is to do a migration to separate logical tables and then build a datamart on them. This will help optimize the load on the storage and allow analysts tasked with building analysis of business efficiency and profitability to answer point questions about vendor rates, shipping costs to different countries, the number of orders delivered in the last week. If you search for this data in the raw delivery log table, the storage load will not be optimal. You would have to complicate queries, which can lead to errors.
An order in an online store is a set of purchased items and their quantity. Customers are used to receiving orders at one time, so each order from a set of products is formed into a single delivery entity.
It is important for the online store to see that the delivery time is respected, and its cost corresponds to the tariffs. He pays for shipping on his own, and the cost of delivery varies by country - this is the basic amount that the vendor takes into account. Under the contract, he makes an additional profit from the commission from the vendor. 
But now this data is stored in one table, shipping, where there is a lot of duplicated and unsystematic reference information. It basically contains the entire shipping log from the time of checkout to the time the order is released to the customer.

### Data

The shipping table, which represents the shipping sequence listed below:

id - unique identifier of the record in the table.
shipping_id - unique identifier of the delivery.
sale_id - unique identifier of the order. Several shipping_id lines can be bound to one order, i.e. logs with delivery information.
order_id - unique order identifier.
client_id - unique identifier of the client.
payment_amount - payment amount (i.e. duplicated information).
state_datetime - updating time of the order status.
product_id - unique product ID.

## Features of the data:
About 2% of orders are executed late, and this is the norm for vendors. Vendor #3, which has a percentage of 10%, is most likely unreliable.
About 2% of orders do not reach the clients.
It is also normal that about 1.5% of the orders are returned by the clients. However, vendor number 21 has 50% of returns. He sells electronics and laptops - evidently his products are defective and worth examining.

## Task.
1. Create a directory of shipping_country_rates from the data specified in shipping_country and shipping_country_base_rate, make the primary key of the table a serial id, i.e. a serial identifier of each line. The directory should consist of unique pairs of fields from the shipping table.
2. Create a directory of vendor shipping rates by shipping_agreement from the vendor_agreement_description row data, separated by ":" (colon without quotation marks).
The field names: 
 
agreement_id,
agreement_number,
agreement_rate,
agreement_commission.
Make agreement_id the primary key.

3. Create a shipping_transfer type guide from the shipping_transfer_description line with a ":" delimiter (colon without quotes). 
 The field names are: 
transfer_type,
transfer_model,
shipping_transfer_rate .
Make serial id the primary key of the table.

Create a table shipping_info, a directory of country commissions, with unique shipping_id and link it with the created directories shipping_country_rates, shipping_agreement, shipping_transfer and constant shipping information shipping_plan_datetime, payment_amount, vendor_id.

4. Create a shipping_status table and include information from the shipping log (status , state). Add there computable information on actual delivery time shipping_start_fact_datetime, shipping_end_fact_datetime . Reflect for each unique shipping_id its final delivery status.

5. Create a shipping_datamart view based on ready-made tables for analytics and include:
shipping_id
vendor_id
transfer_type - delivery type from the shipping_transfer table
full_day_at_shipping - the number of full days of shipping.
Calculated as: shipping_end_fact_datetime -- shipping_start_fact_datetime
is_delay - the status indicating whether the delivery is overdue.
is_shipping_finish - status showing if delivery is complete. 
delay_day_at_shipping - The number of days the delivery was overdue.
payment_amount - the amount of the user's payment
vat - total delivery tax
profit - the total profit of the company from delivery.
It is calculated as: payment_amount *âˆ— agreement_commission
